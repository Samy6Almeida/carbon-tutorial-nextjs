              [Intro]
              <br />
              It's been a while
              <br />
              I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting
              <br />
              But I'm here now
              <br />
              <br />
              [Verse 1]
              <br />
              I know it's been a while, but I'm glad you came
              <br />
              And I've been thinking 'bout how you say my name
              <br />
              You got my body spinning like a hurricane
              <br />
              And it feels like you got me going insane
              <br />
              And I can't get enough, so let me get it up
              <br />
              <br />
              [Pre-Chorus]
              <br />
              Ooh, looks like we're alone now
              <br />
              You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
              <br />
              I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin'
              <br />
              We can turn the heat up if you wanna
              <br />
              Turn the lights down low if you wanna
              <br />
              Just wanna move you, but you froze up
              <br />
              That's what I'm saying
              <br />
              <br />
              [Chorus]
              <br />
              Let me break the ice
              <br />
              Allow me to get you right
              <br />
              Once you warm up to me
              <br />
              Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
              <br />
              Let me break the ice
              <br />
              Allow me to get you right
              <br />
              Once you warm up to me
              <br />
              Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
              <br />
              <br />
              [Interlude]
              <br />
              So are you warming up yet?
              <br />
              <br />
              [Verse 2]
              <br />
              You got me hypnotized, I never felt this way
              <br />
              You got my heart beating like an 808
              <br />
              Can you rise to the occasion?
              <br />
              I'm patiently waiting 'cause it's getting late
              <br />
              And I can't get enough, so let me get it up
              <br />
              [Pre-Chorus]
              <br />
              Ooh, looks like we're alone now
              <br />
              You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
              <br />
              I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin'

              That's what I'm saying

              [Chorus]
              <br />
